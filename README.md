# How to work with the examples

In each of the folders there is a README.md with basic knowledge and examples, so you can (at least I hope) get your knowledge up to speed. Sometimes there is an `index.js` file with tips and instructions 🐨. If you want to complete them make sure you made the steps first:
1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
2. Run `npm install` command (node_modules folder should appear).

To run the test which will check if you've done everything right run the command:
`npm run NUMBER_OF_THE_EXERCISE` for example `npm run 1`. This should run the tests, make them green 💚💚💚. If you don't know
why your test fails it can be good to visit that test's code 🐨.
