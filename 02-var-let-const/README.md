    <h1>var, let, const - which one should I choose?</h1>

There are three ways of declaring a variable - by using var (the old school one), let and const (the new school ones). There is a slight difference between those 3 so lets jump into it.

- [`var`](#var)
- [`let` and `const`](#let-and-const)

## `var`

Before we start we need to know what is Hoisting. It's a JS mechanism which moves stuff declaration to the top of the current scope. It is the default mechanism and it works for `var` keyword. So the code below will work just because of hoisting:

```
x = 5; // it will work, because var declaration which is below is moved to the top by default during compilation on the fly

var x // it's really not that intuitive, I know ðŸ˜…
```

Yeah so that one is kinda strange right? `var` keyword allows you to create a variable which is hoisted and can be changed, so it can be tricky and doesn't give any information, but "I want a variable here" (or not particularly here really ðŸ˜…).

## `let` and `const`

In the newer version of JS `let` and `const` keyword appeared. They don't do that "fancy" hoisting and that's why they are more predictive. Furthermore `const` implies, that the value that you are declaring won't change in the code, so it makes it easier to interpret. `let` on the other hand is like "Take care cowboy ðŸ¤ , this value will be changed further on". So using those is more about
giving information to the dev that will be reading your code instead of really making a difference - you can use `let` in all `const` cases and it won't be an error.

## The rule of thumb

Use `const` and `let` instead of `var` and try to give the dev that will be reading your code as much information as possible.
